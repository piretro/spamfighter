Essential minigame in pure Gideros lua

Small project to demonstrate lua Gideros open source Framework capabilities: 
93 lines of code and 2737 characters, some of which are comments, still open to optimization. 

You need to close every popup by pressing each X button, but beware: it's easier said than done.
